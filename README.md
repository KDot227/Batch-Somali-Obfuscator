If you are AT&T or another major coporation please reach out to me I would like a job im poor.

  How To Use
</h2>

Download python (any version past 3.10)\
Clone repo or download as zip (Then extract repo from zip (Yes people don't do that))\
Run setup.bat\
Have fun obfuscating!

<h1 align="center">
  Detections üòà
</h1>

Runtime test via scanner.to [results](https://scanner.to/result/9Vrtp48P58)

Scantime test via avcheck.net [results](https://avcheck.net/id/yfkokUq7WRIr)

Scantime test via Virustotal.com [results](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/589a7a6e7c45a94e2b8944a340cfe6dfc82068b9a30fce3160c827bf1a5aa437?nocache=1)

So far it's esentially fud when using the fud mode and only detected by 2 av when using the normal mode. Fud mode slightly brings down protection but I intend to fix that within the next update.\
\
Another interesting this is how Virus total currently thinks that the file is Javascript (It obviousily isn't)

<h1 align="center">
  But what if someone tries to deobfuscate ü§ì
</h1>

Have fun and goodluck. If you end up making a full deobfuscator plz show me cause that's impressive

  Features
</h1>

<details>
  <summary>Anti VM</summary>
  Literially checks if the current computer is a VM and if it is it exits
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Anti Echo</summary>
  Looks for any variation of the word ECHO. If it's found it exits. Also some of the other settings make it very very hard to echo commands and understand output
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Anti Byte Change</summary>
  Checks to make sure the first 3 bytes are obfuscated asf
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Environment variable obfuscation</summary>
  Uses built in Windows Environment Variables to help obfuscate code
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Built in var support</summary>
  I went through the dedication to list out nearly every built in var + make a regex that can find them all for multiple instances.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Errorlevel continuation</summary>
  Using errorlevel won't break the code since using goto and labels dont establish an error level unless the label can't be found (which it always should be able to be found)
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Bitwise Opperations (Xor, Or, And)</summary>
  I figured out how you can do bitwise opperations in batch and i'm abusing it.
  Only XOR is used right now since I can't get Or and And to work correctly with each other
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Hot asf</summary>
  ngl from what I've seen, it's the best in the world and hopefully it stays that way
</details>

  Why make this?
</h2>

Long story short baum made [this](https://github.com/baum1810/batchobfuscator) and I thought that it was cool and thought that I could also make something better and so I did. I left it alone after making the first 3 modes but then picked it up again after some kid said that his was better.

<h2 align="center">
  Cool Things
</h2>

Not only is the Obfuscator very fast but it's also very customizable. If you know python code well enough nothing is stopping you from going into the code and changing some of the randint values to occur more frequently making your code more obfuscated and harder to read.

  If you like this repo please give it a star ‚≠ê

Also @ John Hammond cause he's cool and I wanna see him deobfuscate this
