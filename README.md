BUILT IN VARIABLES HAVE A FIX!!!

The only obfuscation mode that supports built in variables is level 3, 4, 5, ultimate, embed and exe. idk why you would use mode 1 over ultimate but it's up to u.

# Why make this?

Long story short baum made [this](https://github.com/baum1810/batchobfuscator) and I thought that it was cool and thought that I could also make something better and so I did. I left it alone after making the first 3 modes but then picked it up again after some kid said that his was better.

## Ultimate.)

## embed.)
No image but it embeds powershell files (ps1 files) at the end of the batch script and when ran the batch script will rerun with powershell which runs the powershell. (I will eventually add Jscript/Wscript and maybe full support for Vbs)
