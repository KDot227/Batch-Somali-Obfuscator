  How To Use
</h2>

Download python (any version past 3.10)\
Clone repo or download as zip (Then extract repo from zip (Yes people don't do that))\
Run setup.bat\
Have fun obfuscating!

Note: You can use the gui version if you want but it's missing a lot of features that the normal version has.

<h1 align="center">
  But what if someone tries to deobfuscate ü§ì
</h1>

Here are a couple of cool things Somalifuscator (ultimate mode) does to make it harder to deobfuscate:
* File can't be opened in notepad or notepad ++
* When you use something such as [this](https://github.com/DissectMalware/batch_deobfuscator) it can't get past this first layer. If you give it a chance and take that layer off it can't even interpret the code because of all the unicode. ON TOP OF THAT even if you have all other settings disabled it STILL won't be able to deobfuscate all the way. This is why Somalifuscator is the best batch obfuscator to ever be made.

  BUILT IN VARIABLES HAVE A FIX!!!
</h3>

The only obfuscation mode that supports built in variables is level 3, 4, 5, ultimate, embed and exe. idk why you would use mode 1 over ultimate but it's up to u.

<h2 align="center">
  Why make this?
</h2>

Long story short baum made [this](https://github.com/baum1810/batchobfuscator) and I thought that it was cool and thought that I could also make something better and so I did. I left it alone after making the first 3 modes but then picked it up again after some kid said that his was better.

<h2 align="center">
  Cool Things
</h2>

Not only is the Obfuscator very fast but it's also very customizable. If you know python code well enough nothing is stopping you from going into the code and changing some of the randint values to occur more frequently making your code more obfuscated and harder to read.

Another thing is that after using modes such as ultimate, you can then use other modes such as level 5 or level 4 to make your code more secure/obfuscated

  All (applies 1, 2 and 3) NOTE THIS IS OUTDATED USE ULTIMATE
</h2>

![all levels (looks the same as level 3 but has levels 2 and 1 also applied)](https://i.imgur.com/g2vvIwo.jpeg)

<h2 align="center">
  The "Ultimate" Batch Obfuscation (You can't open it in notepad or notepad++ or else it crashes)
</h2>

![Ultimate Mode](https://i.imgur.com/flte4s3.jpeg)

<h2 align="center">
  Embed
</h2>

No image but it embeds powershell files (ps1 files) at the end of the batch script and when ran the batch script will rerun with powershell which runs the powershell. (I will eventually add Jscript/Wscript and maybe full support for Vbs)

Also @ John Hammond cause he's cool and I wanna see him deobfuscate this
